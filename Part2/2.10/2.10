Redefined the Dockerfiles to not use ENV variables for API_URL, FRONT_URL to make it easier to
change them in the docker-compose.yml rather than rebuilding the image.

Changed the API_URL to use http://localhost/api/

Changed the FRONT_URL to use http://localhost/

After that it works when accessing localhost. HOWEVER, it does not work if you access the ports. 
say http://localhost:5000/
