This has already been done in the previous exercise. Instead of building from Ubuntu, they are built from
node:14-slim. They can be further optimized by for instance using node:14-alpine, or degraded to a lower 
version of node. I decided to degrade from slim (which doesnt include curl for instance) to alpine, which changed the size in the following ways.

Slim to alpine:
