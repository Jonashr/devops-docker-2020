I first tried building from the image ruby:2.6.0-alpine to make the base image smaller.
However, that caused problems with one of the nokogiri packages during the installation so this 
had to be changed 2.6.0

After changing that another problem occured. It failed during the db migration stage.
A quick google search revealed that the cause was that nodejs was not installed causing problems.

Therefore, I tried juts adding a RUN apt-get install nodejs. However that still did not work, and 
google revealed the reason again. Therefore I added a script to install the nodesource node js 10x repo into the linux system, and then install.

After that building the image worked, and I ran the image with the following command.

docker run -p 3000:3000 ruby-project
